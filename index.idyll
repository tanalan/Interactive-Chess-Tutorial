Hi there! This is an interactive tutorial for how to play [chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess).

It is made using [Idyll](https://idyll-lang.org/).

I've been playing chess for years now, and I taught at elementary schools for about 3 years.

Here are some of my online chess profiles:
* My United States Chess Federation [profile](http://www.uschess.org/msa/MbrDtlMain.php?15174250)
* Lichess profile ([@JuicyKetchup](https://lichess.org/@/JuicyKetchup))

With that said, let us begin!

# The Pieces
## We go in order from most simple, to most complex
* Rook
* Bishop
* Queen
* King
* Knight
* Pawn


Here is how you can use a variable:

[var name:"exampleVar" value:5 /]

[Range min:0 max:10 value:exampleVar /]
[Display value:exampleVar /]

```js
var code = true;
```

And here is a custom component:

[CustomComponent /]

You can use standard html tags if a
component with the same name
doesn't exist.


* *markdown* syntax is supported.

[var name:"state" value:0 /]

[CustomD3Component state:state /]
[button onClick:`state++`]
  Click Me.
[/button]
